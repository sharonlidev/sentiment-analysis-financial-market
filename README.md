# Sentiment Analysis on the Financial Market

This repository implements a machine learning pipeline to analyze **sentiment in financial news and social media** and examine its relationship with stock market performance. It leverages modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to quantify textual sentiment and connect it to financial metrics.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Collect financial textual data** (e.g. headlines, articles, tweets).
- **Process and clean text data** for NLP.
- **Calculate sentiment scores** using machine learning and lexicon-based methods.
- **Analyze correlations** between sentiment and financial market movements (e.g. price changes, volatility).
- **Predict market trends** based on sentiment signals.
